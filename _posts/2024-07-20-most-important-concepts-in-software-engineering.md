In his talk about "Philosophy of Software Design" John Ousterhout  asks a fasziniating question:

If you had to pick one idea, one concept the most important thing in computer science what would you pick



- abstraction
- composition
- complexity
- layers of abstraction
- problem decomposition 
- testing


How do you take a problem or system and chop it up into pieces that you can build relatively independenently


information hiding 

interface 

module / class / component



encapsulation



Problem decomposition

Command and conquer


Interfaces
implementation


Signature /  Body



Deep module / shallow module


Modules

Layers of abstractions

Leaky abstraction

Deep Class / Shallow Class
"the interface is the complexity cost that this class imposes on the rest of the system"



The interface is hiding the information of the class 


abstraction: trying to provide a simple way of thinking about something that is actually quite complicated underneath 

deep classes are good abstractions


function body vs function signature

Decoupling
Tight vs loose coupling

Separation of concerns

Functional vs non-functional requirements


Side effects


Mitigation measures vs root cause analysis
