TIL that you can link to a specific text on a webpage by appending `#:~:text=` to the url, .e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree#:~:text=Trees evolved around 370 million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree#:~:text=Trees%20evolved%20around%20370%20million%20years%20ago). It's called [Text Fragment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments).
