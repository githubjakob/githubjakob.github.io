> "My best holiday was when I was working remotely for 4 weeks from Bali in 2022!" 

My girlfriend likes to quote me saying this, when we once were discussing our holiday plans.

Why am I such a great fan of this "workation" combining working and holiday style of traveling?

In this blog post, I want to share my personal experience with working remotely as a software engineer.



I mean here the temporary "workation" style o<!--  -->f working remotely with an otherwise classical company and an on-site team 
sitting in a real office.

Ideally, you can take away some inspiration for your self or some arguments for negotiating your own workation.

As I want to explain, this style of working remotely does not have to be a trade-off were you bargain some percentage 
from your productivitey for some good private time. In fact, when planned well, you might actually profit in both areas:
increased productivity and have some fun times.


---- 

Over the last years I went to "workation" on multiple occassions, mostly for a time of 2-6 weeks, either combining
it with a "real" vacation for an additional 1-2 weeks, or "raw", only working. 

Since I live and work in Germany, me destinations included Athens, Tunesia, Montenegro and - the classic for digital nomads - Bali/Indonesia.




# Benefits of working "from somewhere else"


As the german anglocism "workation" indicates, this type of working remotely is neither a vacation nor work, but merges both. 



Let's start with the obvisious: working remotly from another place is a huge privilege of knowledge workers like us software developers. We have the privilige of flexible working hours, working from different locations, spending more time abroad,
and ultemitaley experience different cultures.

Since you are not on vacation and keep your daily routine you blend in with the locals 

and experience the lifestyle of your target location through the lense of a local ...

If you stay somewhere for several weeks there are 

specific tasks in your daily routine that you usually would not need to bother about if you where on vacation: 
from grocery shoping, to daily commuting, ... I see all these little tasks as additional advnetures and puzzles that 
spice up my daily routine.

In the morning you have to figure out how the local transportation system works and how and where to buy your
monthly bus ticket, then after some work you eat some dish for lunch that you had never eaten before, 



# Working and Vacation are not mutually exclusive


The term work life balance is often crizied for ... that there is something to be balanced between work and life, ie.
that the 2 areas are different distinct that 


For example one might think that work "is draining our energy" so that we need life or abscence from work to "recharge".

On the other hand taking vacation days is limited so it puts some pressure on us that we should use our vacation days
"efficiently" and "take something from it..". Which in consequence turns vacation times into an obligation.

For me the wonderful and really relaxing realization was that there is not so much 
to balance against it other, but actually "working" can be "recharging" and can be vacation at the same time.
And at the same time the work part of the traveling doesn't take away anything from the vacation part.

Let me explain!





## interrupting boring daily routines 





## feeling less attached / feeling more relaxed 




Sometimes colleagues or clients did not even notice that I was working from somewehre else. Even 
though I was as mcuh transparaent as possible (posted it Slack, mention it in different meetings (Jour Fice, Daily) etc)

the feedback I got was something like this "Yes, I read that you where going somewhere else, but I thought it 
is still to come later since I did not notice anything in "




## Being somewhere else gives you this "outside" perspective and things and allows to focus on what really matters



# Benefits of working from another time


## working from a different timezone can be used as a benefit



understand how timezones work / thinking in UTC + x / UTC - x h


### "being ahead of time"

When my team would wake up in the morning ... I already crushed through all the emails, 
responded to questions in Slack / Jira, and reviewed all open Pull Requests.

When at 3pm slowly messages started to come in and discussions arose, I felt well prepared

I can understand why managers would get up so early. 

Working 5 hours ahead of the rest of the team gives you the feeling of getting up at 5am 
without changing your sleep routine.


## faster feedback

Another benefit is that 


Again I can tell from experience working ahead of the rest of the team that


My colleagues were submitting PRs in the evening and they were just always reviewed the next days.





## less synchronous communication


If you work from another time zone than the rest of the team, there is just less overlap and less hours
that you can fill with meetings or other synchronous forms of work. 

I would argue though that this can be a great benefit! 



### focus time / deep work

Having less time 

forces everybody to be more cautious about the remaining time 


It basically divided the day into two parts for me: 
one part of silent focus time without interruption, and one part for meetings, discussions, pair programming.


### hours of pair programming is a sign of ineffective work style







# Tipps


Be transparent / Overcommunicate

The first tipp is to communicate openly about what you are doing.
Post in Slack or send in Email informing everboy about what you are going to do.



Don't try to hide 

If you are unsure about the exact times you 




Work from a coworking place 



Internet connectivity, buy one or multiple sim cards



Expect to be tired






Embrace the daily routine - this is the fun part


Since you will be living somewhere else you will still have the same daily tasks 
that you have to do at home.
You will need to wash your laundry, buy grocceries, commute to work to be on time for meetings,
unwind in the evening, try to find enough sleep.

Don't try to avoid these things 
Instead take them as part of the experience: 

Is this 


Remember your routine from home, stick to your habits




Don't overplan your free time

The last tipp is to not put too many events in your your free time



I mean you can of course do this all. But from my experience it's also ok to remind yourself 
and just watch a movie in the evening in then go to bed early. 







## NOtes


Maybe I'm weird here but going on vacation for the purpose of "vacation" has a nothing appealing to me
